********Collection Interface*****
**********************************
The Collection interface is the interface which is implemented by all the classes in the collection framework.
It declares the methods that every collection will have. In other words, 
we can say that the Collection interface builds the foundation on which the collection framework depends.

Some of the methods of Collection interface are Boolean add ( Object obj), Boolean addAll ( Collection c), void clear(), etc. 
which are implemented by all the subclasses of Collection interface.


**********List Interface****************

List interface is the child interface of Collection interface. 
It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered collection of objects. 
It can have duplicate values.

List interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.



*********ArrayList**************


The ArrayList class implements the List interface. It uses a dynamic array to store the duplicate element of different data types. 
The ArrayList class maintains the insertion order and is non-synchronized. The elements stored in the ArrayList class can be randomly accessed.


**************LinkedList
LinkedList implements the Collection interface. It uses a doubly linked list internally to store the elements.
 It can store the duplicate elements. It maintains the insertion order and is not synchronized. 
 In LinkedList, the manipulation is fast because no shifting is required.
 
 
 ********************Set Interface********************
 ****************************************************
 
Set Interface in Java is present in java.util package. It extends the Collection interface. 
It represents the unordered set of elements which doesn't allow us to store the duplicate items.
 We can store at most one null value in Set. Set is implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
 
 
 ******************HashSet****************************
 *********************************************************
 
HashSet class implements Set Interface. It represents the collection that uses a hash table for storage. 
Hashing is used to store the elements in the HashSet. It contains unique items



****************LinkedHashSet*************************


LinkedHashSet class represents the LinkedList implementation of Set Interface.
 It extends the HashSet class and implements Set interface. Like HashSet,
  It also contains unique elements. It maintains the insertion order and permits null elements.
  
  
  ***************************TreeSet*************************
  
  
Java TreeSet class implements the Set interface that uses a tree for storage. Like HashSet, TreeSet also contains unique elements. 
However, the access and retrieval time of TreeSet is quite fast. The elements in TreeSet stored in ascending order.
